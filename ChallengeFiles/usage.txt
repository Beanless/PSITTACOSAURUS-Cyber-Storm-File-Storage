We need to write how to execute each of the programs here:

Binary Decoder:
python Binascii.py < binary_file.txt
NOTE: must be 1 long line of binary (text file). If it is multiple lines long, make it 1 line.

Vigenere Cipher:
encoding
python VigenereCypher.py -e < normaltext.txt

decoding 
python VigenereCypher.py -d < ciphertext.txt

FTP Covert Channel:

just use FileZilla lol


Timing Covert Channel:
Manually figure out the timing for the 2 bits, manually figure out what time is 0 or 1, eidt the code accordingly.
Run the code.

TimeLock:
python3 TimeLock.py < epoch.txt
OR
echo "1999 12 31 23 59 59" | python3 TimeLock.py

XOR Crypto:

python3 xor.py < ciphertext > (file to write the output to)


Steg:
python Steg.py -rs -bB -o[Offset] -i[Interval] -w[wrapper file name] -h[name of hidden file] 
-i is the interval used to store the data
-o is the offset of the file
-b or -B is the bit and Byte method respectfully
-w is the name of the wrapper file
if using -r (reading hidden file) disregard the -h command (dont use it)
if using -s (saving a hidden file) MUST use -h (name of the file to hide)
